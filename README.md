StackView is not only a powerful layout tool, it can also be used to create some pretty interesting animations with little effort.

How you can utilize them:
  - Try animating the layout axis
  - Transformation properties (scale, position, rotation, etc..)
  - A combination of these

Let me know what cool animations you come up with!
